        <h2>About Our Project</h2>
        <p>
            The Water Surface Cleaning Robot is designed to tackle one of the major environmental challenges of today: water pollution.
            Our innovative robot autonomously navigates water bodies such as lakes, ponds, and rivers, efficiently collecting surface debris,
            plastics, and pollutants to improve water quality and preserve aquatic ecosystems. Equipped with advanced sensors and monitoring capabilities,
            the robot also measures water quality metrics like pH and turbidity in real-time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our project aims to provide a sustainable solution for maintaining clean water surfaces, promoting environmental conservation,
            and contributing to global efforts in combating pollution. With automated cleaning, real-time data collection, and extended battery life,
            our robot is a step forward in eco-friendly technology.
